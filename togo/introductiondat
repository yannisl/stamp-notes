Togoland, was an important German colony on the West Coast of Africa. This was the scene of the first Allied attempt to carry the war into the enemy's 
territory. Togoland was the plave where the German army had installed a central
wireless system that linked the whole of the Colonial system to Berlin. The possession of this
system was of enormous strategic importance to the allies and accordingly became the 
main objective of the British Expedition from the Gold Coast, which occupied Lome,
the capital and port of Togoland on __August 7th 1914__. Anticipating the invasion, the German forces
had retired inland to __Kamina__ (about 100 miles from Lome). Here after some desultory fighting,
the British Expedition (which had meanwhile been joined by a French detachment from dahomey) arrived on
__August 26th 1914__, and received the unconditional surrender of the Colony at the hands of
the German Acting-Governor.

When the German administration were transferred to Kamina before the arrival off the
British forces, all stamps, specie etc., were likewise sent inland, so that on taking over
control of Lome, the British military authorities were unable to find any
trace of them.

A small supply of current Gold Coast postage stamps, however
formed part of the equipment of the expedition and these were brought into use as early as August 8th, 1914, the day following
the occupation and were postmarked with the old German canceller, inscribed __Lome Togo Gebeit__.

At {{wi:Kamina}} a considerable hoard of ex-german Colonial stamps was discovered. The manner of the finding being related in the following
extract from a letter written by a member of the Expedition (a Mr. Pope) to a friend in N. Wales, dated October 5th, 1914:

<blockquote>
when we invaded Togo, we could find no trace of their stamps at any of the P.P's. It appears that
all postmasters had instructions to send them in to headquarters, and they were taken to Kamina and buried somewhere; also a great amount of money.
All that could be found was 37 boxes of 250 marks each, which were in a well in Kamina.
