\chapter{Introduction}

Madagascar is an island 1,000 miles long and 400 miles across lying along the east coast of Africa. Situated in the path of adventurous mariners the island has been visited by numerous Europeans the first of which were probably Portuguese in 1500. The native stock comprising the origins of the Malagasy people are thought to derive from successive waves of immigrants from around Indonesia, of which the earliest reached the shores of the great island some centuries before the Christian era. These immigrants spoke a Malayo-Polynesian language which in turn has absorbed a diversity of other tongues from Arab
and African influences.

An indication of early interest shown in the island is a map of Madagascar (circulated), engraved in 1528 by Benedetto Bordone.\footnote{This map appears in \textit{Isolario di Benedetto} published in Venice in 1547.} This had been preceded by a Portuguese map drawn in 1502 by Cantinho of islands off the Mozambique coast.2 Unable to convert the Malagasies to Christianity and finding no gold, silver or ivory the Portuguese abandoned Madagascar early in the seventeenth century.

French interest dates from 1643 when the French Eastern Company, a chartered company formed during the early years of Louis XIV's reign, took possession of the island in the name of the King of France. Even with such royal backing, small French settlements at Fort Dauphin and Sainte Marie were the object of hostile attack by Malagasy tribes, driving the settlers out in 1672. These tribes warred among themselves as part of the creation of larger territorial units. In 1787 the Imerina state situated on the island's high plateau, and founded by a people later called the Merina, brought to the tribal throne a prince named Andrianampoinimerina. This remarkable, illiterate man deflected Merina warlike energies to consolidation of his rule over the entire central region of high plateaux.

Welding the Merina into a united people, he initiated outstanding administrative, judicial and fiscal reforms. This king was succeeded in 1810 by his son, an exceptionally able warrior and administrator, who took the name of Radama I. King Radama reorganised and modernised the Merina army, extending his kingdom at the expense of the Betsimisaraka and Sakalava tribes, and, of more lasting significance, he extended a friendly welcome to Europeans, especially the English and French.

\section{British naval victory in 1811}

Meanwhile the French governed Mauritius until its capture in 1810 by the British who set about driving
the French from the west part of the Indian Ocean. Letters survive written from Fort Dauphin in
Madagascar on 6 November 1775 to France, and again in 1779 to Bordeaux, as sold from the Hunt
collection in 1956.1 have a letter written in July 1810 by Robert Gordon from HMS Phoebe, a fifth rate
ship,3 telling of preparation for setting sail for the Cape of Good Hope. The letter reports: '. . . from
thence to look for a fine fat French frigate coming from the Isle of France very richly laden. If we come
alongside of her I have no doubt but that we shall show them some good sport. . .'
On 20 May 1811 the battle of Tamatave was fought close to Madagascar resulting in a defeat of the
French at English hands by which the Phoebe was well thought of in England. A medal was awarded to
all English participants. According to a report by Farquhar, then Governor of Mauritius, this success
freed these seas from the last French flag, and secured to the British an unmolested traffic into Madagascar.

This battle is illustrated in my collection by a letter from Gordon, a 14-year-old boy 2nd Class RN who retired an admiral. You can imagine the young lad's anticipation in the early hours of morning awaiting one of his first sea battles from which he might not have survived, and writing to 'My Dear Father', signing himself 'Your very dutiful son'. Robert would have written such a letter on the halfdeck of the Phoebe.

\section{British missionaries 1818-60}

This success was followed within a few years by the appearance in Madagascar of the first representatives from the London Missionary Society in November 1818. Entry to the island of the first missionary Rev David Jones with his wife and child followed the previous year's treaty by which England recognised the Hova King Radama I, then 26 years old. This treaty was signed with Sgt James Hastie, an Irishman who came from India with his regiment to Mauritius. He had great difficulty in arranging implementation of the treaty involving annual shipments of arms, money and clothing. Eventually in order to keep the French out of the Malagasy Court he undertook the treaty obligations at the risk of
personal ruin.

Throughout the nineteenth century the English and French were very strong rivals at the Royal Court in Antananarivo directly benefiting the Malagasy. Fourteen missionaries were sent by the LMS between 1820 and 1830 from whom letters survive in that society's archives. Some letters written during the years 1823 to 1834 have 'escaped from captivity'. They usually bear oval post office handstamps of Mauritius indicating handling on their way to packet ships for Europe. The missionaries worked among the Malagasy particularly on translation of the Bible, The Pilgrim's Progress and other books, and compilation of an English-Malagasy dictionary. I have several of these letters signed by John Canham,
James Freeman, David Griffiths, David Johns, David Jones, and Richard Kitching.

Queen Ranavalona I succeeded King Radama in 1828 imposing a reign of terror, the main consequences of which were expulsion of all foreigners, a requirement that professing Christians should take a poison drink, and severance of relations with foreign powers. The last missionaries left in July 1836. Severe persecutions occurred in 1837, 1840, 1849 and 1857 earning for the Queen the title of 'Cruel'.

\section{French interest re-awakened}

In 1831 Jean Laborde, a master mechanic who had made a fortune in India, was shipwrecked on the
Madagascar coast. After an introduction to the Court he became the Queen's Armourer. He and another
Frenchman, M Lambert, built up relations with the French government in Paris.
Between 1839 and 1841 the Sakalava tribe revolted against Ranavalona's severe regime and were
defeated, in common with the French, taking refuge in Nossi-Be, Mayotte and other islands. The French
claimed these territories and took formal possession of Nossi-Be in 1841. In this way the French gradually
gained concessions and advantages leading eventually to conquest of the Hovas and possession of
the whole of Madagascar.

I have regarded the later period of Ranavalona's reign from 1836 to 1861, when she died, as 'the dark age' during which there can have been almost no communication with the outside world. Visits to the island by the widely-travelled missionary the Rev William Ellis in 1853, 1854, and 1856 served to keep the British name before the Malagasy court.4 In the display was a letter referring to cultivation of various crops written from Nossi-Be in 1846 and sent to Europe via [Reunion](../reunion/introduction).

\section{Col Middleton 's diplomatic visit of 1861 and the missionaries' French mail -1862-69}

In 1861 King Radama II succeeded his mother, the cruel queen, and immediately made it known that
the British would be welcomed and trade could be re-opened with the Malagasy. Forthwith the Governor
of Mauritius sent a deputation to pay respects to the new king under the command of Lieut-
Colonel Middleton. This party was feted and several letters from 1861-62 survive in the author's
collection. One of these advised the party on their conduct during the journey,'... to speak to the native
guides neither too roughly, nor too mildly; to speak too mildly would make the journey to the capital too long.' Other letters concern gifts of food during the journey, greetings from the Court, and in 1862 a
proposal that Middleton should attend the King's coronation. During this period it was customary for
letters to be carried by native runner from Antananarivo to Tamatave, the east coast port; some bear
manuscript crosses, of which I believe three together indicate an 'express' letter.
Meanwhile in October 1861 King Radama II wrote to William Ellis that Protestants would be free to
come to Madagascar under the King's protection. On receipt of this letter the directors of the London
Missionary Society decided that Ellis should proceed to Madagascar, at the same time suggesting that
perhaps he should be authorised to convey a message of goodwill from Queen Victoria's government.

Ellis thus became a central figure in the slightly hostile rivalry which then developed between Protestant and Roman Catholic interests.

Several letters sent between 1862 and 1864 to Mauritius bear that island's ship letter handstamp and inscription of the 6d rate for a letter from Madagascar, a distance of 550 miles. One of these is written by Ellis in November 1862 from the capital, Antananarivo, to Mrs Higginson in Mauritius. Judging from letters seen from a number of missionaries to Mrs Higginson she must have been their devoted supporter.

In 1863 King Radama II was strangled in a desperate tragedy arising through protection he afforded to friends sheltering from a movement by the anti-Christian party to massacre Christians. He was succeeded by Queen Rabodo who agreed to vest real power in a Prime Minister and a Council of thirty.

Shortly after, the two Consuls Pakenham and Laborde were curtly informed, 'The guilty are dead. Rabodo is Queen of Madagascar'.

A long letter of 10 December 1866 written by Rev. H Maundrell to Mrs Higginson describing
missionary work among the natives and referring to official relations between the Queen and Thomas
Conolly Pakenham, appointed Her Britannic Majesty's Consul for Madagascar in 1862.
There were also examples of mail sent by the French Suez packet from the French portion of Madagascar
in 1864-66 organised under Mayotte and its Dependencies. Double circle handstamps demonstrating
this were on view from Nossi-Be and Mayotte, two of the islands claimed by the French in 1841.

The French general colonies issues, namely the Eagle and Ceres designs, were used in these islands. In Mayotte a dotted lozenge with a void centre and a double circle datestamp were applied to Eagles from August 1864 to 1878 and to Ceres or Napoleon stamps from 1874 to 1877. Nossi-Be had a dotted lozenge with NSB at the centre, which is known cancelling Eagles only in 1868. The Ceres issue is known used at Nossi-Be between 1874 and 1880 cancelled by a double circle datestamp. Exceptionally the French metropolitan issue of 1862 was used. Shown was an envelope sent on 8 September 1866 with a pair of
20 centimes and a 10 centimes used to make up the 50 centimes letter rate from Mayotte to France via Suez. These stamps were cancelled in blue by Mayotte's void lozenge.

In 1869-70 interesting examples of mail survive addressed to the London Missionary Society from
Antananarivo bearing Mauritius adhesives. The example shown carried Is 4d in adhesives, the Mauritius
9d accountancy handstamp, and 'l/5d.' inscribed in violet ink at the lower left corner. I suggest that
'l/5d.' was written by the missionaries in Madagascar; it comprised Id within Madagascar, 6d letter
rate to Mauritius, and lOd single letter rate Mauritius to England, of which Mauritius was entitled to
Id and 9d was due to the UK.

\section{Commercial mail and the Consul - 1870}

A delightful letter of 1870 addressed from Tamatave to Port Louis, Mauritius merits closer attention. It
has the usual '6d/TO PAY' Mauritius handstamp and a striking impression in dull red of the oval seal
of the British Consulate in Madagascar. At the side of this strike is the manuscript annotation
'Tamatave 15 August, 1870 T.C. Pakenham'. So far as I know this is the only example of mail
demonstrating the fact that from 1868 Pakenham was acting as Postmaster for the British community.
The commercial content refers to the facility for handling bills of lading and other valuable
documents provided by the Consul.

A pair of letters of 20 April 1871 to the same business from Tamatave arriving in Mauritius four days apart appears at first sight to offer a typical example of post office idiosyncracy. This is not the case, however, because the quicker letter bearing a crayon '5/-' in place of the handstamp '6d/TO PAY' contains the answer in its content. Evidently the business house in Madagascar had earlier requested a supply of silver coin for the island's monetary system and found demand for specie smaller than anticipated.

Accordingly, to avoid holding an undue quantity of cash, £400 of silver was returned to Mauritius accompanied by this letter on which the sender considered 5s a necessary expense for the safety of his consignment.

\section{French diplomacy and the blockade of 1870-75}

Relations with France deteriorated under pressure from Catholic parties who considered that their
church was put in an unfavourable position by influence exerted by British Protestant missionaries on
the Merina ruling classes ; a further pretext for French intervention arose from the influence of two
British missionaries, Pickersgill and John Parrett, a printer, who persuaded Sakalava chiefs on the northwest
coast opposite Nossi-Be to hoist the Merina flag. French gun-boat diplomacy secured lowering of
the Merina flag but caused further reaction to this aggression. The presence of the French military in
Mayotte and Nossi-Be is shown by the application of 'CORR. D. ARMEES' datestamps to envelopes
from 1870 to 1871.

These developments resulted in a blockade by the French of the island's main port at Tamatave in the years 1870-75. As a consequence incoming mail for Madagascar was held at Mauritius and the 6d charge for carrying a single letter was indicated by a 6d green adhesive of Mauritius, and by a handstruck '6d/TO PAY' on letters returned to Mauritius in 1870-71. Difficulties arising from the blockade were surmounted by use of other minor Malagasy ports, and gave strength to the considerable complaints made by the British community to the Foreign Office in London. Particular annoyance was
aroused by the 6d charge resulting in a petition to Pakenham from not only the households connected
with the London Missionary Society and the Friends' Foreign Mission Association, but also on behalf
of the Norwegian Missionary Society, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and the shipping
agents Porter, Muir & Lang and Proctor Bros. The petition offered to accept a charge up to Is per letter
if a separate mail bag from England to Madagascar could be handled by Pakenham. The Foreign Office
took note of these views and for a short time British steamers were subsidised to carry mail
to Madagascar. The use of a 6d green adhesive on envelopes addressed to Madagascar was displayed.
On 21 July 1871 the GPO in London issued an instruction that all mail for Tamatave should be forwarded
in the mails pre-paid only as far as Mauritius or Reunion by French packet, a further charge
being raised for conveyance to their destination. At this time the lOd charge for a 4x>z letter from England
to Mauritius excluded 6d for conveyance to Madagascar.

An example of the 6d green adhesive in use during the blockade in 1875 occurs on an envelope
addressed to the Rev Alfred Chiswell at Antananarivo bearing a manuscript alteration indicating Chiswell's promotion to archdeacon. This promotion was earned by Chiswell in his missionary labours
for the SPG in Madagascar from 1867 and his share in translating the prayer book into Malagasy.

Examples of mail from England to Madagascar in 1879-80 illustrate the annoyance caused to the British community by 6d levied by the French Post Office in Mauritius. Envelopes from this period are franked at the lOd per 1/2 oz letter rate of which 70 centimes, equivalent to 6d, was accounted for by crayon endorsement. One of the letters from correspondence addressed to Isaac Sharp shows a triple rate of 2s 6d incorporating 2 francs 10 centimes, or Is 6d, for conveyance to Madagascar. Isaac Sharp was a Quaker who travelled extensively as a minister visiting the Friends' Foreign Mission workers at Antananarivo in 1879-80.

\section{Forwarding agents and the Malagasy Royal Court - 1875-77}

The community of aliens in Madagascar made use of shipping agents involved in the island's commerce and having correspondent offices in France and England. Marks were shown of a forwarding agent representing each country, (1) Roux de Fraissinet et Cie of Tamatave and Marseilles and (2) Proctor Brothers of Tamatave and London. The first in black is indicated by 'AGENCE DE TAMATAVE/ R. F. & C' within a rectangular frame with corners cut diagonally applied in December 1875. The second is an unframed blue oval cachet reading 'FORWARDED BY/PROCTOR BROTHERS/TAMATAVE' of May 1877. In each case the agent would probably have collected the postage from the sender but, not being agents of the Post Office, they simply struck the mail with their firm's stamp and forwarded it privately. On arrival in Marseilles or London the local office of the agent despatched the letter in the
French or British postal system after affixing a stamp representing the local postal rate.
Reference has already been made to Queen Rabodo's forced delegation of power to a Council and
Prime Minister. This principal office was held by Rainilaiarivony, following his promotion from Foreign
Minister in 1869, until 1895 when the Royal family was exiled. Correspondence from the Court was
carried by native runners in official 'Passport' envelopes, of which an example was shown, attributed to
1876 by previous owners. Authority on the envelope for the Royal courier's safe conduct was given by
the vermilion impression of a crown within a circle.

It will be realised that the GPO would not recognise Malagasy Court mails and so we find that adhesives were applied on mail from even the highest official in the land, when destined for, say, England.

An envelope of 1877 to the Friends' Foreign Mission Association bears a pair of Is yellow of Mauritius and impressed with a fine seal of the Prime Minister no less than 60mm in diameter. The letter rate to England was reduced to 6d from 1877, indicating a quadruple rate of 2s for the Prime Minister.
