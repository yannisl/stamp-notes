\chapter{Drainage System}

\newthought{The Drainage System is already at an advanced stage}

Work that could be completed has been completed, especially in the Podia. In the Towers, Rotana and Shangrila are not expected to present a problem. Areas that are currently incomplete are second and third fix activities
in all public washrooms and main kitchens. For these areas information is still oustanding and or the Main Contractor's works have not been completed. This ~~is deleted text.~~

\newthought{Drainage Planrooms} such as the Grey Water Treatment Plant is substantially completed in terms of Mechanical Works and the balance works, including electrical works are expected to be completed by end of August.

From a systems point of view our aim is to be able to pour water at the highest point
in the Tower and see it flowing into the Municipal Drain or the Grey Water Treatment Plant etc.
as soon as possible. This has been partially achieved during wild air, but has also exposed areas in Towers where risers have been erroneously reported as completed.

The installation can be divided into the following broad sections



\begin{table}

The PM/Engineer in Charge should plan and direct works towards Systems, whereas
Supervisors in charge should focus on Completing Areas. A smaller Team can get involved with
close-outs.

The Podium Engineer Siripanthi is responsible to report for the total system including Towers
and prioritization of materials. The Tower Engineers are responsible to hand over the reports to
Siripanthi for collation and issuing before the COB every Thursday.


\subsection{Current Organization}

The person responsible for overseeing the drainage installations as an integrated system is Sripathy. 
Tower Engineers and PMs are managing the subcontractors. A Senior Supervisor has been added to the Team to assist in closing issues in all Grey Waste Water Plantrooms and External Works.
